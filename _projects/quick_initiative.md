This is a small React application for running combat in d20 based roleplaying games. I created it mostly as an exercise to experiment with React Hooks, and partly because existing initiative tracking tools didn't quite suite my preferred workflow.

## Features
- Supports HP tracking and quickly duplicating entries.
- History, saved using client-side data-storage using the local storage API.

## TODOs
- Support mobile-size screens

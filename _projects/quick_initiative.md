This is a small React application for running combat in d20 based roleplaying games. I created it mostly as an exercise to experiment with React Hooks, and partly because existing initiative tracking tools didn't quite suite my preferred workflow.

## Features
- Supports HP tracking and quickly duplicating entries.
- Entry history and groups, saved on the client using the local storage API.

## Todos
- Support mobile-sized screens.
- Explore React unit-testing libraries.

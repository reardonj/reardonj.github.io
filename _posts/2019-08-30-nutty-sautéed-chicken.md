title: Nutty Sautéed Chicken
categories: [Food]
---
This recipe came about from me casting around the internet for recipes to use up leftover cashews, and is heavy derived from [this](https://www.wholekitchensink.com/paleo-cashew-chicken/) recipe. 

I'm loathe to call the sauce a 'peanut sauce', as its proportions are largely reversed from a typical peanut sauce. The lighter flavour does give more room for the rest of the flavours in the dish to come out.

## Ingredients

<div class="columns" markdown="1">

<div markdown="1">
### Sauté:
* 1lb chicken thighs
* 3 scallions
* 2 cups broccoli florets
* 1 bell pepper
* 2 carrots
* 1/2 cup unsalted cashews
* 2-3 cloves garlic
</div>

<div markdown="1">
### Sauce:
* 1/4 cup stock (chicken or vegetable)[^stock]
* 2 tablespoons peanut butter[^butter]
* 4 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 teaspoon ginger
* 1 tablespoon honey
</div>

</div>

[^stock]: I used vegetable bullion.
[^butter]: The sort made with nothing but peanuts. Other 100% nut butters should work to similar effect.

## Instructions
0. Thinly slice the bell pepper and the scallions, separating white bottoms and green tops. Peel the carrots and cut into thin rounds, halving large carrots first. Mince the garlic and ginger. Mix the sauce ingredients together in a bowl.

0. Pat the chicken dry and cut into bite-sized chunks. Season with salt and pepper.

0. Heat a large frying pan to medium-high. Add oil and the chicken chunks. Stir occasionally, until browned all over, about 3-5 minutes.

0. Add the garlic, bottom halves of the scallions, broccoli, carrots and bell pepper to the pan and continue cooking, stirring occasionally for another 5 minutes.

0. Add the sauce to the pan, and stir to coat. Continue cooking until the sauce has thickened and starting to bubble. Stir in the cashews, and serve with the green tops of the scallions for garnish.

## Notes
**Serve With.** I did brown rice to accompany the dish. I'd expect it to work well with udon noodles too, with a bit more sauce for the noodles to soak.

**Spicy?** This dish tastes like there should be a spicy version of it. It might just be replacing the peppers with hot ones, or reworking the sauce. This is on my TODO list.

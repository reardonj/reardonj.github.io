title: Ending Racism in Canada

Let's review the past two weeks. I'm sure everyone reading has seen the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in the United States. Meanwhile in Canada…Regis Korchinski-Paquet went from talking to Toronto police to falling to her death in a few minutes. Then an RCMP officer in Kinngait ran down an Inuk man with his vehicle. Thursday, Chantel Moore was shot five times at her Edmundston home, by the officer called to help her.

It was also the one year anniversary of the release of the Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. We're still waiting to hear how the government is going to implement its recommendations.

But they haven’t had just one year. These were not freak events. They are a few more names in the long list of victims of centuries of racist government policies and conduct, documented by a litany of commissions and inquiries over the past few decades.

It's time for our politicians to do more than take a knee, say they’re against racism, and strike yet another committee. We need policies and funding to break the cycle of poverty so many Indigenous, black and other racialized Canadians are caught in. We need to deliver emergency services in a way that doesn't increase the odds of people dying. We need to make sure governments — municipal, provincial and federal — follow through, because this isn't a problem that will be fixed this year, or even this decade.

If that is what you want to happen, if you want to live in a better world, there is a lot of work to do. We need politicians and community leaders to hear our demands for change, and actually act. We need to support anti-racist charities and be anti-racist ourselves. We need to listen to the oppressed. We need to make it clear to our friends, family, and children that a racist world is not an acceptable world.

If we don't, Canadians will keep suffering and keep dying senseless deaths.

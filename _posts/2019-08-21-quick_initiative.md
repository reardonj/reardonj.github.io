This is a small React application for running combat in d20 based roleplaying games. I created it mostly as an exercise to experiment with React Hooks, and partly because existing initiative tracking tools didn't quite suite my preferred workflow.

This was my first attempt at a React app, written shortly after hooks were released. I implemented a custom event-based model that should be replaced with a proper state management library if I get back to working on this.

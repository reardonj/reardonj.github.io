title: Notes on Building This Site
categories: [Coding]
---
It has been about a decade since I've web development, but not a whole lot seems to have changed for basic HTML work. The few changes that have happened made setting this site up easier though:

* CSS Flexbox is a *massive* improvement over fiddling with floats and Clearfix hacks. 
* Media queries exist, and responsive pages are standard now!
* HTTPS has gone from something for important sites to the default.
* I can update the site via `git push` instead FTP.

## Technical Details

* This is a static HTML site, generated using [Jeykll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
* The design is based on [this template](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie), updated to use Flexbox layout, among other tweaks.
* The source is available on [Github](https://github.com/reardonj/reardonj.github.io)

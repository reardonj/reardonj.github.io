title: "Pizza Dough: First Attempts"

Several weeks ago a friend gifted me with a pizza stone she wasn't using, so I figured it was time to up my pizza making efforts and make my own dough to go with it!

## Attempt 1

I'm partial to thin-crust doughs, so poked around the internet, finding a likely [recipe on Kitchn](https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-homemade-thin-crust-pizza-recipes-from-the-kitchn-45499). The first attempt had a few issues:

* I didn't give the oven long enough to heat the stone, and cooking took the better part of 15 minutes.
* The dough was not very easy to stretch into rounds. The end result was thicker than I would have liked. I suspect I added a little too much flour.

## Attempt 2

Shortly after my first attempt, an [extensive discussion on bread making](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21232209) came up on Hacker News. In addition to providing a lot of material for my future reading, a commentator linked to [Jeff Varasano's Famous New York Pizza Recipe](http://www.varasanos.com/PizzaRecipe.htm). I haven't attempted that recipe, but did incorporate the autolysing method he describes into the Kitchn recipe in hope of making it stretch more easily.

This attempt worked out much better! I made a single round this time, but could have probably halved it and gone even thinner. Spreading the dough was very easy. I preheated the oven to 500°F instead and gave it some more time, which gave me an 8 minute cooking time.

## Current Recipe

### Ingredients

* 3/4 cup lukewarm water
* 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
* 240g (2 cups) all-purpose flour, separated 180g and 60g
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* cornmeal

### Instructions

0. Preheat oven and stone to 500°F. Pour the water into a bowl then add the yeast, 180g of flour and the salt. Mix gently until completely blended. Then cover and let rest for 20 minutes.

0. Start kneading gently for 5 minutes. If kneading manually, it might be easier to start in the bowl with a spoon. Start adding flour slowly over the next few minutes. Stop adding flour early if it is getting to the right consistency.[^leftovers] Cover and let rest for another 20 minutes.

0. Scatter cornmeal over your work area Stretch the dough into a thin round, about 14 inches, incorporating the cornmeal into the underside the the dough to prevent sticking. Transfer to a pizza peel and top as desired.

0. Transfer to the pizza stone and cook for about 5-8 minutes. Remove from the oven to a rack and let rest a few minutes before cutting and serving.

[^leftovers]: I had about 15g left on my first attempt.

## Future Work

This recipe works pretty well. At some point in November I'm planning to look at making sourdough instead of using dry yeast.

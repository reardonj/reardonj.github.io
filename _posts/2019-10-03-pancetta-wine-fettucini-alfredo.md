title: Pancetta & Wine Fettucini Alfredo

A new issue of [Food & Drink](http://foodanddrink.ca/fooddrink/magazine/en/Autumn2019/FDAU19.html) recently came out, with a [variation](https://www.lcbo.com/lcbo/recipe/white-wine-fettucine-alfredo/F201905013) on fettucini alfredo I was keen to try. However, I had some pancetta in the fridge to use, and wasn't cooking for four any time soon. So, I tweaked the recipe, invited a friend over and picked out a bottle of wine to make my own version:
## Ingredients


<div class="column-list" markdown="1">

* 50g pancetta, cubed
* 1/2 tbsp butter
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1/2 cup white wine[^wine]
* 150 ml whipping cream (35%)
* 120g fettuccine
* 50g Parmigiano-Reggiano
* 1-2 stalks of flat-leaf parsley
* ground nutmeg
</div>
[^wine]: I used a bottle of [2017 Simonsig Chardonnay](https://www.lcbo.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/lcbo/simonsig-chardonnay-2017-345389) and washed down dinner with it. It was excellent.

## Instructions
0. Finely shred the cheese. Remove most of the parsley stem and finely chop. Mince the garlic.

0. Heat a medium saucepan to medium-high. Add the pancetta. Stir occasionally until browned all over, about 3-5 minutes. Remove the pancetta to a bowl using a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pot. Fill a large pot with salted water and bring to a boil while you perform the next steps.

0. Lower the burner to medium. Add the garlic and cook for about a minute. Add a bit of the wine to deglaze the pot.

0. Pour in the rest of the wine. Bring to a gentle simmer, stirring frequently until the wine is reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Then stir the cream in slowly and continue simmering for another 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

0. While the cream mixture is simmering add the fettuccine to the pot of boiling water and cook until a little short of al dente [^aldente]. Reserve a quarter cup or so of the pasta water and drain[^oil].

0. Once the sauce is reduced, add the pasta and stir, coating it thoroughly. Continue cooking for a few minutes until the pasta is al dente. Stir in the cheese and parsley. If the sauce is getting too thick, add a bit of the reserved water. Stir in the butter and then the pancetta. Season to taste with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Serve!

[^aldente]: A minute or two less than the package directions should be good.
[^oil]: If the sauce still needs some time, toss with a bit of oil so it doesn't stick together.

## Notes
**Serves:** 2.

**Timing:** Ideally, you'll finish the pasta and sauce about the same time so the pasta doesn't have a chance to cook before you stir it in.
